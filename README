You may need some prerequisites first. If you're on CentOS/RHEL, make sure to 
install CPAN and use those packages, since yum no longer supports some 
required packages.   
For CentOS 6/7:

    yum install -y perl-devel cpan make
    cpan Test::More
    cpan Params::Validate Math::Calc::Units Class::Accessor::Fast Config::Tiny

For Debian 7+/Ubuntu 14.04+:

    apt-get install make libperl-dev libparams-validate-perl libmath-calc-units-perl libclass-accessor-perl libconfig-tiny-perl

For Fedora 25+:

    dnf install -y make perl-devel 'perl(Params::Validate)' 'perl(Math::Calc::Units)' 'perl(Class::Accessor::Fast)' 'perl(Config::Tiny)' 'perl(Test::More)'

To install this module type the following:
